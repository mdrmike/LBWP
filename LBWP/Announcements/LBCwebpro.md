The __Long Beach Web Professionals__ group meets monthly to showcase our cool tech projects, share best practices, network with each other, help newcomers, and the values of open source software (F/OSS).  We strive to do this in a professional, relaxed, respectful, and open venue for _all people_ in our community.

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Below are some potential topics for future meetups, or at least conversation starters when we get together:
